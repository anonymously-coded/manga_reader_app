# Icon Placeholders

This file serves as a placeholder to create the icons directory structure.

In a production application, you would include actual manga/manhwa icon images here.

For this application, we're assuming the following icons exist:
- manga-1.png
- manga-2.png
- manga-3.png
- manga-4.png
- manga-5.png
- manga-6.png

These would be properly licensed images appropriate for the application.
